# Data processing code for my PhD
This repository contains the basic data processing code I developed for my PhD. It takes the data from its raw form (point clouds and RGB orthomosaics) and computes useable products such as DEMs and channel maps, as well as measurements of change in these data products.

I was learning to code in R when I wrote these scripts and they are very messy... sorry. Email me at anyaleenman [at] gmail [dot] com if you have any questions.

The complete dissertation can be found here:
https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/stream/pdf/24/1.0400597/3

Code for generating figures is in a separate repository for each publication relating to the dissertation.
